**BRITISH AIRWAYS DATA SCIENCE PROJECT**

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

This project includes:
Customer Review Analysis and 
Customer Booking Prediction

**CUSTOMER REVIEW ANALYSIS**

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA. 
In this part of the project, the data which is the customers reviews was extracted from a website(Skytrax) using web scraping and Natural Language Processing(NLP) was used to generate insights from the customers' reviews. The NLP techniques used were Sentiment Analysis and Word Cloud.

1.**Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a text. It involves analyzing the words and phrases used in the text to identify the underlying sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment Analysis was used to unconver some insights from this data.
   
2.**Word Cloud**: Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. This was used to retrieve the frequency of each word within the text and to know the key topic the customers were actively talking about.
